I am a Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Director of the [Human and Machine Learning (HaML) Lab](https://hamllab.org). I use computational modeling and analysis of neuroimaging data to understand human memory.

In 2025, I wrote an open textbook on Data Science for Psychology, covering data analysis, visualization, statistics, and reporting using Python:
* [Data Science for Psychology Textbook](https://mortonne.github.io/datascipsych/intro.html)
* [Course code repository](https://github.com/mortonne/datascipsych)

I've developed a number of software packages for research:
* [Psifr](https://github.com/mortonne/psifr): Analysis and visualization of free recall data.
* [PsifrR](https://github.com/mortonne/psifrr): R package for analysis and visualization of free recall data.
* [CyMR](https://github.com/cmr-sims/cymr): Computational modeling of free recall data.
* [WikiVector](https://github.com/mortonne/wikivector): Tools for quantifying conceptual knowledge based on Wikipedia entries.
* [PsiReact](https://github.com/mortonne/psireact): Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of response time data.
* [Mindstorm](https://github.com/mortonne/mindstorm): Advanced neuroimaging analysis.
* [Wiki2Vec](https://github.com/prestonlab/wiki2vec): Modeling semantic similarity of well-known stimuli.
* [fPrep](https://github.com/prestonlab/fprep): Scripts for preprocessing of fMRI data using FSL, FreeSurfer, and ANTS.
* [Aperture](https://github.com/mortonne/aperture): Matlab toolbox for univariate and multivariate analysis of EEG data.
