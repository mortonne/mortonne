I work at the Center for Learning and Memory at The University of Texas at Austin, using computational modeling and analysis of neuroimaging data to understand human memory.

I've developed a number of software packages for research:
* [WikiVector](https://github.com/mortonne/wikivector): Tools for encoding Wikipedia articles as vectors.
* [Psifr](https://github.com/mortonne/psireact): Analysis and visualization of free recall data.
* [CyMR](https://github.com/mortonne/cymr): Computational modeling of free recall data.
* [PsiReact](https://github.com/mortonne/psireact): Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of response time data.
* [Mindstorm](https://github.com/mortonne/mindstorm): Advanced neuroimaging analysis.
* [Wiki2Vec](https://github.com/prestonlab/wiki2vec): Modeling semantic similarity of well-known stimuli.
* [Aperture](https://github.com/mortonne/aperture): Matlab toolbox for univariate and multivariate analysis of EEG data.
